A homomorphic encryption scheme is an encryption scheme that allows computing functions on encrypted data. Such a scheme was first presented by Gentry in [].
This scheme is built on what is known as a "somewhat" homomorphic encryption scheme (SHE), which allow the evaluation of a limited set of functions on encrypted data. [idealhom]

In this literature review we first present a concrete SHE scheme. We then present a Multiparty Computation (MPC) protocol based on this SHE scheme.
