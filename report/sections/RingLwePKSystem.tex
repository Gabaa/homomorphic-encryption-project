\section{Ring-LWE - A somewhat-homomorphic encryption scheme} \label{sec:RLWE-theory}

In the paper ``Fully Homomorphic Encryption from Ring-LWE and Security for Key Dependent Messages'' written by
Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan \cite{brakerski2011fully},
the authors describe a method for using the ring learning with errors (Ring-LWE) problem to construct an encryption scheme,
which reduces to the worst-case hardness of problems on ideal lattices \cite{brakerski2011fully}.
We will shortly describe the encryption scheme here, but will omit proofs and detailed discussions.

\subsection{Polynomial learning with errors}

Polynomial learning with errors (PLWE) is a variant of the Ring-LWE problem.
The decisional PLWE problem is parameterized by a polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ where $deg(f) = N$, a prime $q \in \mathbb{Z}$, a distribution $\chi$ (specifically an error distribution over elements in $R_q$), and an integer $\ell$ (a limit on the number of samples given in the problem).
$f$ defines the ring $R = \mathbb{Z}[x] / \langle f(x) \rangle$, and $R$ and $q$ together define $R_q = R / q R = \mathbb{Z}_q[x] / \langle f(x) \rangle$.
An instance of the problem is then written as $PLWE_{f, q, \chi}^{(\ell)}$.

\begin{definition}[The $PLWE_{f, q, \chi}^{(\ell)}$ assumption]
    Let $s$ be a uniformly random element from $R_q$.
    Then it holds that 
    \[
        \{ (a_i, a_i \cdot s + e_i) \}_{i \in [\ell]} \approx^{c} \{(a_i, u_i) \}_{i \in [\ell]}\}
    \]
    where all $a_i$ and $u_i$ are uniformly random elements from $R_q$, and all $e_i$ are sampled from $\chi$.
\end{definition}

Likewise, the decisional $PLWE_{f, q, \chi}^{(\ell)}$ problem is then to distinguish how a set of $\ell$ samples was generated: as elements of the form $(a_i, a_i \cdot s + e_i)$, or of the form $(a_i, u_i)$.

Beside the decision variant, the PLWE problem could also be stated in terms of a search problem, one in which
an adversary has to find the secret vector $s \in R_q$.

\subsection{Symmetric encryption scheme}

Now we summarise a symmetric encryption scheme based on PLWE as defined in \cite{brakerski2011fully}.

Let $\kappa$ be the security parameter and let further $p$ and $q$ be prime numbers where $p \in \mathbb{Z}_N^*$.
We also need a polynomial of degree $N$: $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and an error distribution $\chi$ over the ring
$R_q = \mathbb{Z}_q[x] / \langle f(x) \rangle$, and with the message space $R_p = \mathbb{Z}_p[x] / \langle f(x) \rangle$.
Then we can define the following operations for a somewhat-homomorphic symmetric encryption scheme.

\subsubsection{Key generation}
Let our secret key be a randomly sampled element from the error distribution $s \getsrand{} \chi$.
Then, given the security parameter $\kappa$, sample a ring element $s$ uniformly at random from $\kappa$ and define the
secret key vector by $(s^0, s^1, s^2, \dots, s^D) \in R_q^{D+1}$, where $D$ is related to the maximal degree of homomorphism allowed.

\subsubsection{Encryption}
All messages are encodeable in our message space $R_p$, thus we will encode our message $m$ as a degree $N$
polynomial with coefficients modulo $p$.
To encrypt, we sample $(a, b = a \cdot s + p \cdot e)$ where $a \getsrand{} R_q$ and $e \getsrand{} \chi$,
then compute
\begin{align*}
    c_0 \coloneqq b + m &  & c_1 \coloneqq -a
\end{align*}
and from this output the ciphertext \textbf{c} $\coloneqq (c_0, c_1) \in R_q^2$.

\subsubsection{Decryption}
Note that a ciphertext is on the form $(c_0, c_1, \dots , c_D) \in R_q^{D+1}$.
Define the inner product over $R_q$ as
\begin{align*}
    \langle c, s \rangle = \sum_{i=0}^D c_i \cdot s^i
\end{align*}
Then to decrypt, simply set $m$ as the inner product of $c$ and $s$ and take modulo $p$.
\begin{align*}
    m = \langle c, s \rangle \bmod p
\end{align*}
$m$ will then be the decrypted message.

Note that for decryption to work correctly, we require that the $\ell_\infty$ norm (defined as the largest absolute coefficient in the polynomial) for the polynomial $\langle c, s \rangle$ is less than $q / 2$.

\subsubsection{Eval}
To obtain the homomorphic abilities of the encryption scheme, Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan show
how to obtain homomorphic addition and multiplication of ciphertexts.
\\[2mm]
\textbf{Addition:} Assume we have 2 ciphertexts $c \in R_q^{D+1}$ and $c' \in R_q^{D+1}$, then an encryption
of the sum of the 2 underlying messages will be
\begin{align*}
    c_{Add} = c + c' = (c_0 + c'_0, c_1 + c'_1, \dots , c_d + c'_d) &  & c_{Add} \in R_q^{D + 1}
\end{align*}
The decryption of $c_{Add}$ will then be the sum of the unencrypted messages from $c$ and $c'$.
\\[2mm]
\textbf{Multiplication:} Assume we have 2 ciphertexts $c \in R_q^{D+1}$ and $c' \in R_q^{D'+1}$ and let $v$ be a symbolic value.
Then calculate the updated ciphertext $(\hat{c}_0, \hat{c}_1, \dots, \hat{c}_{d+d'}) \in R_q^{D + D' + 1}$ as
\begin{align*}
    c_{mul} = (\sum_{i=0}^D c_i \cdot v^i) \cdot
    (\sum_{j=0}^{D'} c'_i \cdot v^i) =
    \sum_{i=0}^{D+D'} \hat{c}_i \cdot v^i
     &  & c_{mul} \in R_q^{D+D'+1}
\end{align*}
The output of the multiplication operation will then be $c_{mul} = (\hat{c}_0, \hat{c}_1, \dots, \hat{c}_{D+D'})$

\subsection{Public-key encryption scheme}
%TODO: m√•ske der skal skrives noget om lemma 4?
To achieve a public-key encryption scheme instead, we introduce the error distribution $\chi '$ with standard deviation $r'$.
Then, we can make the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In the key generation we generate in addition to the secret key $sk = s \getsrand{} \chi$, a public key
        $pk = (a_0 , b_0 = a_0 \cdot s + p \cdot e_0)$, where $a_0 \getsrand{} R_q, e_0 \getsrand{} \chi$.
    \item In the encryption algorithm, we use a public key to calculate the ciphertext as
        $(a_0 \cdot v + t \cdot e', b_0 \cdot v + p \cdot e'')$ where
        $v, e' \getsrand{} \chi$ and $e'' \getsrand{} \chi '$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{On the security of PLWE}
    To later generate a secure set of parameters for our encryption scheme, we will have to touch a bit on the security.
    Several considerations come to play when thinking about the security and optimizations, most noticeably the choice
    of a proper function $f(x)$. The best well-known attack should also come into consideration.
    A lot of math, including calculations on lattices and especially ideal lattices, are needed for a proper discussion of the
    choices to be made in choosing secure parameters, but we will only briefly outline those processes, as it is not the main focus of this project.

    \subsubsection{On the choice of functions $f(x)$}
        The choice of function $f(x)$ is normally set to be a cyclotomic polynomial. One way to choose a cyclotomic polynomial is on the form of $f(x) = x^N + 1$ where $N$ should be chosen as $N = 2^k$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$.
        Doing so, we get some useful algebraic properties, which opens for optimizations and adds to the security, as described in section \ref{sec:abstract-she-theory}.
        Therefore, we will without further discussion choose $f(x)$ as a cyclotomic polynomial.

    \subsubsection{Reducing RLWE to LWE samples}
        Another important property to see is that any RLWE sample of the form $(a, s \cdot a + e)$,
		where $a \in R_q$ and $s, e \getsrand{} \chi$ can be written into $N$ LWE samples by using the following method.
        Let $A_a$ be the matrix of multiplication by $a \in R_q$, then we get $N$ LWE samples by
        \begin{align*}
            (A_a, \textbf{b} = \textbf{s}^T \cdot A_a + \textbf{e}^T)
        \end{align*}
        where $\textbf{b} \in (\mathbb{R} / q\mathbb{Z})^N$ and $e \in \mathbb{R}^N$ \cite{peikert2016not}.

    \subsubsection{Parameter testing tool} \label{sec:lattice-reduction}
        Martin Albrecht, professor at the university of Royal Holloway in London, is the current maintainer of an
		open-source project~\cite{estimations-tool} geared towards choosing secure parameters for the RLWE encryption scheme.
		By using this tool, we will be able to calculate the amount of security by using the lattice reduction algorithm BKZ \cite{usenix16}.
		We will be using this tool to evaluate the equivalent symmetric security level,
		while still holding the degree of the function $f(x)$ to a minimum for performance reasons.
		The tool will use lattice based mathemathics to calculate the amount of security, which will be given
		to us in the form of a number $\beta$, that will then be used to test the security level.
        For the precise usage of the tool, we have used the following Sage script:
        \lstinputlisting[language=Sage]{code-snippets/estimator.sage}
        In this, we can vary the parameters of our modulus $q$, the degree of the cyclotomic-polynomial $N$,
        our noise distributions on $r$ and $r'$ (Xs, Xe) and the value of $m$ typically provided by the authors.

    \subsubsection{Best known attack}
		The best known attack on the LWE scheme is the BKZ lattice reduction algorithm, which by the earlier mentioned method to divide RLWE into $N$ LWE samples, also gives an attack on RLWE.
		We will not be going into how BKZ works, but will mention that the security level from the BKZ algorithm
		has been shown in the "New Hope" paper \cite{usenix16} written by Alkim and Poppelman to be
		\[ 2^{0.292 \cdot \beta} \]
		where we can get the value of $\beta$ from the testing tool.
