We have implemented the system as described by Ivan et al. \cite{damgaard2012multiparty}, with some modifications to better suit the Rust programming language and the specifics of our system, as well as to improve the performance and allow reuse of secret-shared material.

The preprocessing phase is clearly a bottleneck in the system, which may be due to multiple factors, most notably not having implemented component-wise multiplication.

Without the implementation of component-wise multiplication, the system seems to run into one of two scenarios.
In one scenario, the cryptosystem is insecure with respect to the results from the LWE estimator tool, due to choosing too small parameters.
In the other scenario, the MPC system is too slow to use in practice.

For future work, it could be valuable to improve the performance of the system, so that it can be run practically while still being secure.
