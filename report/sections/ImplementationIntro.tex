\noindent For the implementation part of the project we first implemented the Ring-LWE cryptosystem described in section x.x. We then used this for implementing the MPC protocol described in section x.x, while making slight deviations to allow for reuse of secret-shared values, as described in section x.x. The code for the protocol was written in the programming language Rust.
In this chapter we describe the implementation details of these systems.
