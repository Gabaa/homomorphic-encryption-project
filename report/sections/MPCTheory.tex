\section{Protocol for Multiparty Computation based on SHE} \label{section: MPC scheme}

The Multiparty Computation (MPC) problem is the problem where $n$ players each with some private input $x_i$, want to compute some function $f$ on the input, without revealing anything but the result.

In \cite{damgaard2012multiparty} the authors describe a protocol for MPC based on a SHE scheme. The protocol is able to compute arithmetic formulas consisting of up to a single multiplication, along with a relatively large number of additions, while being statistically UC-secure against an active adversary and $n - 1$ corruptions.

The protocol proceeds in two phases. In the first phase, preprocessing, a global key $[\![\alpha]\!]$, random values in two representations $[\![r]\!], \langle r \rangle$, and a number of multiplicative triples $\langle a \rangle, \langle b \rangle, \langle c \rangle$ satisfying $c = ab$ are generated.

In the second phase, the online phase, the players use the global key and secret-shared data generated in the preprocessing phase to do the actual computations.

The online phase therefore only makes indirect use of the SHE scheme, as it is only used in the preprocessing phase to generate input for the online phase.

These two phases are described in further detail in section \ref{subsection: Prep} \& \ref{subsection: Online}.

\paragraph{Representations of shared values}
The protocol makes use of two different representations of shared values $[\![ \cdot ]\!], \langle \cdot \rangle$.

The first representation used for the protocol, $[\![ \cdot ]\!]$, is defined in the following way:
$$[\![ a ]\!] = ((a_1, ..., a_n), (\beta_i, \gamma(a)^i_1, ..., \gamma(a)^i_n)_{i = 1, ..., n})$$
where $a = \sum_i a_i$ and $a\beta_i = \sum_j \gamma(a)^j_i$. Thus the $\gamma(a)^j_i$ values are used to authenticate $a$ under $P_i$'s personal key $\beta_i \in \mathbb{F}_{p^k}$. Each player $P_i$ then has the shares $(a_i, \beta_i, \gamma(a)^i_1, ..., \gamma(a)^i_n)$. To open a $[\![ \cdot ]\!]$ value each player $P_j$ sends $a_j, \gamma(a)^j_i$ to $P_i$, who checks that $a\beta_i = \sum_j \gamma(a)^j_i$. Afterwards $P_i$ can compute $a = \sum_i a_i$.

For a shared value $a \in F_{p^k}$ the $\langle \cdot \rangle$ representation is defined as follows:
$$\langle a \rangle := (\delta, (a_1, ..., a_n), (\gamma(a)_1, ..., \gamma(a)_n))$$
where $a = \sum_i a_i$ and $\alpha (\delta + a) = \sum_i \gamma(a)_i$. The $\gamma(a)_i$ values are thus MAC values used to authenticate $a$. Such a value is shared s.t. each party $P_i$ has access to the global value $\delta$ along with shares $(a_i, \gamma(a)_i)$. Multiplication by a constant and regular addition are then defined entry-wise on the representation, while addition by a constant is defined as $$c + \langle a \rangle := (\delta - c, (a_1 + c, ..., a_n), (\gamma(a)_1, ..., \gamma(a)_n))$$
When a value $\langle a \rangle$ is partially opened, it means that the value $a$ is revealed without revealing $a$'s MAC values.

\subsection{Abstract SHE scheme and instantiation} \label{sec:abstract-she-theory}

The cryptosystem used as the SHE scheme in the protocol has to have certain properties to be admissible. The authors of the MPC protocol present a concrete instantiation of such an abstract SHE scheme, using the Ring-LWE based public key encryption scheme by Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan \cite{brakerski2011fully} described in section \ref{sec:RLWE-theory}.

\paragraph{encode and decode}
To be able to use this scheme we have to define the function \textbf{encode}, which maps elements in the plaintext space $M = (\mathbb{F}_{p^k})^s$ to elements in a ring $R$, which is equivalent to $\mathbb{Z}^N$. In addition to this we also need to define a function \textbf{decode}, which maps elements in $\mathbb{Z}^N$ to $M$, s.t. $\textbf{decode}(\textbf{encode}(m)) = m$ for $m \in M$.

To do this we first have to pick a polynomial for the quotient ring $R = \mathbb{Z}[X]/\langle f(x) \rangle$ used by the cryptosystem. Picking $f(x)$ in a specific way allows an optimization, which makes it possible to do entrywise multiplication, such that we can perform $N$ multiplications in parallel \cite{damgaard2012multiparty}.
To do this we pick $f(x)$ to be the $m$'th cyclotomic polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $N = \phi(m)$, s.t. modulo $p$ the polynomial $f(x)$ factors into $l'$ irreducible factors of degree $k'$, where $l' \geq s$ and $k$ divides $k'$.

We can then define the function $\phi: M \rightarrow R_p$ which embeds $M$ into $R_p$. We also define $\iota : R_p \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^N$, which maps the coefficients from the polynomial given as input to a vector of length $N$ with coefficients in the range $(-p/2, ..., p/2]$.

Finally, we define $\textbf{encode}(\textbf{m}) = \iota(\phi(\textbf{m}))$ and $\textbf{decode}(\textbf{x}) = \phi^{-1}(\textbf{x} \; (\text{mod } p))$.

\paragraph{key distribution and distributed decryption}
In addition to the aforementioned requirements, we also want the cryptosystem to implement a functionality $\mathcal{F}_{KeyGenDec}$. This functionality will on receiving ''start'' from all honest players generate a keypair $(pk, sk)$, and then distribute $pk$ to the players and store $sk$. The players can then use the functionality to cooperate in decrypting a ciphertext encrypted under $pk$.
We have omitted the description of a protocol that implements the functionality, but it can be found in \cite{damgaard2012multiparty}.

\subsection{Preprocessing phase} \label{subsection: Prep}

The preprocessing phase is implemented by the following protocol, which consists of the steps \textbf{initialize}, \textbf{pair}, and \textbf{triple}. These steps use the additional protocols Reshare, PAngle, and PBracket as subroutines \cite{damgaard2012multiparty}.

\paragraph{Protocol Reshare:}
The Reshare protocol distributes shares of a plaintext, given the ciphertext, to all parties, without revealing the plaintext to any of the players.
Specifically, it takes a ciphertext $e_m$ as input and a parameter $enc$, which can be set to either $NewCiphertext$ or $NoNewCiphertext$. The protocol then outputs a share $m_i$ of the plaintext $m$ to each player along with a new fresh ciphertext $e'_m$ if $enc = NewCiphertext$, where $e'_m$ contains $\sum_i m_i$.
The protocol proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each player $P_i$ samples $f_i \in \mathbb{F}_{p^k}$, and then broadcasts $e_{f_i} \leftarrow Enc_{pk}(f_i)$.
    \item Each player $P_i$ runs the ZKPoPK protocol (as defined in \ref{sec:zkpopk-theory}) as a prover on $e_{f_i}$, aborting if any proof fails.
    \item Each player $P_i$ homomorphically adds $e_f \leftarrow e_{f_1} \boxplus ... \boxplus e_{f_n}$ and $e_{m+f} \gets e_f \boxplus e_m$.
    \item The players collectively use $\mathcal{F}_{KeyGenDec}$ to decrypt $e_{m + f}$ so that they get $m + f$.
    \item Player $P_1$ sets $m_1 \gets m + f - f_1$, and each other players $P_i$ sets $m_i \leftarrow - f_i$.
    \item If $enc = NewCiphertext$, then each player each computes $e'_m \leftarrow Enc_{pk}(m + f) \boxminus e_{f_1} \boxminus ... \boxminus e_{f_n}$ using default randomness, and gets output $(m_i, e'_m)$.
    \item If $enc = NoNewCiphertext$, then each player $P_i$ gets output $m_i$.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Protocol PBracket:}
The PBracket protocol produces a value in the $[\![ v ]\!]$ representation, given a ciphertext $e_v$ along with privately held shares $v_1, ..., v_n$.
% TODO [meg]: Write the actual protocol with itemize
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For $i = 1, \dots, n$, every player $P_j$ computes $e_{\gamma_i} \leftarrow e_{\beta_i} \boxtimes e_v$, and gets the share $\gamma^j_i$ by calling Reshare with $e_m = e_{\gamma_i}$ and $enc = NoNewCiphertext$.
    \item The players output $[\![ v ]\!] = ((v_1, ..., v_n), (\beta_i, \gamma(v)^i_1, ..., \gamma(v)^i_n)_{i = 1, ..., n})$.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Protocol PAngle:}
The PAngle protocol produces a value in the $\langle v \rangle$ representation, given a ciphertext $e_v$ along with privately held shares $v_1, ..., v_n$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each player $P_i$ computes $e_{v \cdot a} \leftarrow e_v \boxplus e_\alpha$.
    \item The players collectively run Reshare with $e_m = e_{v \cdot \alpha}$ and $enc = NoNewCiphertext$, such that each player $P_i$ receives a share $\gamma_i$ of $v \cdot \alpha$.
    \item The players output $\langle v \rangle = (0, (v_1, ..., v_n), (\gamma_1, ..., \gamma_n))$.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Initialize:}
The \textbf{initialize} step generates the global and personal keys.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each player sends "Start" to $\mathcal{F}_{KeyGenDec}$ and obtains the public key $pk$.
    \item Each player $P_i$ samples $\alpha_i, \beta_i \in \mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ and broadcasts $e_{\alpha_i} \leftarrow Enc_{pk}(Diag(\alpha_i)), \;\; e_{\beta_i} \leftarrow Enc_{pk}(Diag(\beta_i))$, where $Diag(a) = (a, a, ..., a) \in (\mathbb{F}_{p^k})^s$.
    \item Each player $P_i$ runs the ZKPoPK protocol twice as a prover with $diag = True$, on $e_{\alpha_i}$ and $e_{\beta_i}$, each repeated $sec$ times, aborting if any proof fails.
    \item Each player $P_i$ homomorphically adds the encrypted shares $e_{\alpha_i}$ to get $e_\alpha$.
    \item The players collectively run PBracket with their shares $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ to obtain $[\![ Diag(\alpha) ]\!]$.
    \item Then the players output $[\![ Diag(\alpha) ]\!]$ as the global key and each $P_i$ gets $\beta_i$ as their personal key.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Pair:}
In \textbf{pair} the players generate random values in the two representations $[\![ r ]\!], \langle r \rangle$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each player $P_i$ samples a share $r_i \in (\mathbb{F}_{p^k})^s$ and broadcasts $e_{r_i} \leftarrow Enc_{pk}(r_i)$.
    \item Each player $P_i$ runs the ZKPoPK protocol as a prover on $e_{r_i}$, aborting if any proof fails.
    \item Each player $P_i$ homomorphically adds the encrypted shares to get $e_r \gets e_{r_1} \boxplus \dots \boxplus e_{e_n}$.
    \item The players collectively run PBracket to get $[\![ r ]\!]$ and PAngle to get $\langle r \rangle$.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Triple:}
The \textbf{triple} step generates triples $(\langle a \rangle, \langle b \rangle, \langle c \rangle)$ satisfying $c = ab$. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each player $P_i$ samples $a_i, b_i \in (\mathbb{F}_{p^k})^s$ and broadcasts $e_{a_i} \leftarrow Enc_{pk}(a_i), \;\; e_{b_i} \leftarrow Enc_{pk}(b_i)$.
    \item Each $P_i$ runs the ZKPoPK protocol as a prover first on $e_{a_i}$ and then on $e_{b_i}$, aborting if any proof fails.
    \item Each player $P_i$ homomorphically adds the encrypted shares to get $e_a$ and $e_b$.
    \item The players collectively run PAngle to get $\langle a \rangle$ and $\langle b \rangle$.
    \item Each player $P_i$ homomorphically multiplies $e_a$ and $e_b$ to get $e_c$.
    \item The players collectively run Reshare with $e_m = e_c$ and $enc = NewCiphertext$, such that each player $P_i$ receives a share $c_i$ of $c$ and a new ciphertext $e'_c$.
    \item The players collectively run PAngle to get $\langle c \rangle$.
    \item Each player $P_i$ gets the output $(\langle a \rangle, \langle b \rangle, \langle c \rangle)$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Online phase} \label{subsection: Online}
% TODO [meg]: Write the actual protocols with enumerate
The Online protocol implements the online phase, and consists of the steps \textbf{initialize}, \textbf{input}, \textbf{add}, \textbf{multiply}, and \textbf{output} \cite{damgaard2012multiparty}.
These steps are executed as needed to evaluate the arithmetic circuit that we wish to evaluate.

\paragraph{Initialize:}
The \textbf{initialize} step simply consists using the preprocessing protocol to generate a global key $\bracketr{\alpha}$, along with enough multiplicative triples and random values in the $\angler{\cdot}$ and $\bracketr{\cdot}$ representations showed earlier, for the circuit that we want to evaluate.

\paragraph{Input:}
The \textbf{input} step lets a player $P_i$ share their private input $x_i$. The input is shared by taking a pair $[\![ r ]\!], \langle r \rangle$, and then opening $[\![ r ]\!]$ to $P_i$ so that $P_i$ gets $r$. Following this $P_i$ computes and broadcasts $\epsilon \leftarrow x_i - r$. All players finally set $\langle x_i \rangle \leftarrow \langle r \rangle + \epsilon$.

\paragraph{Add:}
To add two values $\langle x \rangle, \langle y \rangle$, we simply perform the component-wise addition $\langle z \rangle = \langle x \rangle + \langle y \rangle$, meaning that each player adds their shares locally $z_i = x_i + y_i, \gamma(z)_i = \gamma(x)_i + \gamma(y)_i$.

\paragraph{Multiply:}
To multiply two values $\langle x \rangle, \langle y \rangle$, we use two multiplicative triples $(\langle a \rangle, \langle b \rangle, \langle c \rangle)$ and $(\langle f \rangle, \langle g \rangle, \langle h \rangle)$. We use the second triple to check that $ab = c$, but this could also be done in preprocessing instead.
To do this check we first open $[\![ t ]\!]$ to get t, then partially open $t \cdot \langle a \rangle - \langle f \rangle$ and $\langle b \rangle - \langle g \rangle$ to get $\rho$ and $\sigma$ respectively. 
Finally, we compute and partially open $$t \cdot \langle c \rangle - \langle h \rangle - \sigma \langle f \rangle - \rho \langle g \rangle - \sigma \rho$$
if the result is $0$, then we conclude that $ab = c$ and move on, otherwise the players abort.

Now, partially open $\langle x \rangle - \langle a \rangle$ and $\langle y \rangle - \langle b \rangle$ to get $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ respectively. Finally, we output $$\langle z \rangle \leftarrow \langle c \rangle + \epsilon \langle b \rangle + \delta \langle a \rangle + \epsilon \delta$$

\paragraph{Output:}
To output a value y given $\langle y \rangle$, the players do the following.
First, a random value $[\![ e ]\!]$ is opened so each player gets $e$, which is used to compute $$a = \sum_j e^j \cdot a_j$$ where $a_j$ are all of the opened values of the form $\langle a_j \rangle$.
Each player $P_i$ then uses the commitment functionality $\mathcal{F}_{Commit}$ as in \cite{damgaard2012multiparty} to commit to $\gamma_i \leftarrow \sum_j e^j \gamma(a_j)_i$ along with $y_i$ and $\gamma(y)_i$.
Then, the global key $[\![ \alpha ]\!]$ is opened.
The players then use $\mathcal{F}_{Commit}$ to open $\gamma_i$ and then check that indeed $$\alpha(a + \sum_j e^j \delta_j) = \sum_j \gamma_i$$
If this is not the case, then the players abort.
Finally, to make sure that all players end up with $y$ the commitments to $y_i$ and $\gamma(y)_i$ are opened. Now the players check that $\alpha(y + \delta) = \sum_i \gamma(y)_i$, and if this is the case, then $y = \sum_i y_i$ is output, and otherwise they abort.

\section{Reuse of unrevealed secret-shared data} \label{section: Reuse}

In \cite{damgaard2013practical} a technique that allows for reuse of unrevealed secret-shared data is used.
This technique revolves around not having to reveal the global key $[\![ \alpha ]\!]$, and in fact we do not even need the $[\![ \cdot ]\!]$ representation when using this technique.

% TODO [meg]: Write the actual protocols with enumerate
The technique works as follows.
First, when we generate the global key we now just need each player $P_i$ to have a share $\alpha_i$ of $\alpha$. In the output step the player will then instead of the current MAC check instead invoke the new MACCheck protocol on all of the values in the $\langle \cdot \rangle$ representation that have been opened, and if this succeeds the player invokes MACCheck on the output value $\langle y \rangle$. The MACCheck protocol works as follows:

\paragraph{Protocol MACCheck}
% TODO [meg]: Write the actual protocols with enumerate
First each $P_i$ samples a seed $s_i$ and use $\mathcal{F}_{Commit}$ to broadcast $\tau^s_i \leftarrow Commit(s_i)$. Following this each player opens all commitments using $\mathcal{F}_{Commit}$ to get all $n$ seeds $s_j$. Now, all players set $$s \leftarrow s_1 \oplus ... \oplus s_n$$
Players then use $s$ as seed to sample a random vector of length $t$ with entries in the interval $[0, p)$.
All players compute $$a \leftarrow \sum^t_{j = 1} r_j \cdot a_j$$ where the $a_j$'s are the values in the $\angler{\cdot}$ representation that have been opened.
Now, $P_i$ computes
\begin{align*}
    \gamma_i \leftarrow \sum^t_{j = 1} r_j \cdot \gamma(a_j)_i \text{  and  } \sigma_i \leftarrow \gamma_i - \alpha_i \cdot a
\end{align*}
Player $i$ then uses $\mathcal{F}_{Commit}$ to broadcast $\tau^\sigma_i \leftarrow Commit(s_i)$.
All players invoke $\mathcal{F}_{Commit}$ to open the commitments received to get the $\sigma_j$'s.
Finally, the players check that $\sigma_1 + ... + \sigma_n = 0$, and if this is not the case, then they abort.

\section{Zero-knowledge proof} \label{sec:zkpopk-theory}
    In \cite{damgaard2012multiparty} a zero knowledge proof of plaintext knowledge is shown in figure 9 and 10.
    We have implemented the zero knowledge from figure 10, as they the authors state that it will be better suited for implementation.
    % TODO: skal vi skrive det eller kan vi bare smide et billede ind? også forklare hvad det er for nogle variabler der bliver sat?

\section{Parameter setting for the MPC system} \label{sec:choosing-parameters}
    When choosing our parameter sets for the MPC system it is important to think not only of the security, but also of
    the practicality of the systems.
    We are already limited in the parameters we can pick from the restrictions outlined in section x.x, but in the article \cite{damgaard2012multiparty} from Ivan et al. we are provided with additional limitations that we have to adhere to.
    We will here outline these limitations, but will omit the proofs and justification as those are outside the scope of our project.
    Let $N = deg(f(x))$, let $r$ be the standard deviation of our error distribution $\chi$, $SEC$ be $40$, the amount of players $n = 3$ with $c_{SEC}, Y$ and $Z$ defined by
    \begin{align*}
        c_{sec} &= 9 \cdot N^2 \cdot SEC^4 \cdot 2^{SEC + 8} \\
        Y       &= \frac{p}{2} + p \cdot (4 \cdot C_{m-bound} \cdot r^2 \cdot N^2 \cdot 2 \cdot \sqrt{N} \cdot r + 4 \cdot C_{m-bound} \cdot r^2 \cdot N^2) \\
        Z       &= C_{m-bound} \cdot N^2 \cdot n^2 \cdot c_{sec}^2 \cdot Y^2 + n \cdot c_{sec} \cdot Y
    \end{align*}
    Then the article specifies that the following inequalities for $q$ and $r$ need to hold.
    \begin{align*}
        q   &> 2 \cdot Z \cdot (1 + 2^{sec}) \\
        r   &> max\{3.2, 1.5 \cdot \gamma^{-t'} \cdot q^{1 - \frac{N}{t'}}\}
    \end{align*}
