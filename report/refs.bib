    abstract="We present a somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme that is both very simple to describe and analyze, and whose security (quantumly) reduces to the worst-case hardness of problems on ideal lattices. We then transform it into a fully homomorphic encryption scheme using standard ``squashing'' and ``bootstrapping'' techniques introduced by Gentry (STOC 2009).",
